          <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
          <p> VirtualEd is a community-based tool to increase the accessibility and availability 
              of high-quality education. We advocate for a world in which people have equal 
              educational opportunities — the recent digitization of educational materials and 
              content has opened the door for this goal to become a reality. With VirtualEd, 
              any student with access to the internet can have syllabi and course materials 
              — literature curated by leading experts in a field — at their fingertips. 
              And better yet, students can upload their course materials and contribute to 
              the repository, building a learning community among their fellow classmates. 
              At VirtualEd, students are helping students learn. Together, we grow best. </p>
