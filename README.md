it should be incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. 

To run our project:

* Make sure that you have all the requirements listed in Requirements.txt.

* In your terminal, execute the following commands: 
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run

The website should run on a local host.
